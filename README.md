# The design was based on a Morphological anlysis with the following criteria  
1. Motor Type
* DC, AC, Servo
2. Number of Tires 
* 2, 3, 4
3. Body Shape 
* Rectangle, Tringle, Square
4. Body Material
* Aluminum, Wood, Steel 

# Three approaches were presented as follow
1. First Approach
* Dc Motor, 2 Wheels, Tringle body, Wood material 
2. Second Approach
* Ac Motor, 2 Wheels, Square body, Aluminum material
3. Third Approach 
* DC Motor, 4 Wheels, Rectangular body, Aluminum material

# The third approach was chosen for the following reasons 
1. DC motors 
*	Less expensive than AC motors.
*	Easy installation.
*	High starting torque.
*	Linear speed-torque curve.
*	Convenient to be used for small appliances.
2. Number of Tires 
* 4 Tires helps in stabilising the body
3. Body Shape 
* Rectangular shapes was cosen to have more space for the instrument
4. Body Material
* Aluminum used for more durability and weight management
